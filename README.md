# Case Study  
## Project Overview  

### The Problem  
Wind Hill Growers wanted to create a stronger online presence and better connect with their customers. They needed a way to make their product recommendations more personal and engaging. Without an existing system or large budget, they sought a simple yet effective web application to showcase their products and provide tailored suggestions based on customer preferences.  

## The Goal  
The goal was to design and build a web app that could take user input, such as preferences and needs, and deliver personalized product recommendations. It had to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and easy for the company to maintain.  

## My Role  
As the UX Designer and Developer, I took on the project from start to finish:  
- **Design**: I created the user interface in Figma, focusing on a clean, intuitive layout that aligned with the company’s branding.  
- **Development**: I built the application from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and engaging experience across devices.  
- **Functionality**: Using JavaScript, I developed a system to process user inputs and generate customized product suggestions, adding an interactive and dynamic element to the site.  

This project was a perfect blend of creativity and technical skill, showcasing my ability to deliver a solution that’s both functional and delightful to use.
